# ECE385
 
code for Arcy and Emily, TA Dohen Jeon Spring 2023


To play our Final Project: The Legend of Zuofu, you would just need to connect the MAX-10 Lite to a VGA display and a USB keyboard via the ECE 385 I/O Shield. 

Just compile the code and program the FPGA, and Generate BSP, Build All, and Run Configurations on Eclipse to enable USB Keyboard input.
