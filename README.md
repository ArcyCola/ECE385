# ECE385
 
code for Arcy and Emily, TA Dohen Jeon <3 Spring 2023


To play our Final Project: The Legend of Zuofu, you would just need to connect the MAX-10 Lite to a VGA display and a USB keyboard via the ECE 385 I/O Shield. 

Just compile the code and program the FPGA, and Generate BSP, Build All, and Run Configurations on Eclipse to enable USB Keyboard input. 

Again, thank you to Prof. Zuofu Cheng, our TA Dohen Jeon, CA's/UA's Anushya, Ian, Pramod, and everyone else who helped us during this semester!

We hope you all do amazing things in your lives. <3
